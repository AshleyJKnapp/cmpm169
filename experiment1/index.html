				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>An animated visualizer synced up to BPM. Press any key and keep tapping along with a rhythm to find the BPM of your taps. While tapping, the visualizer will sync up to the BPM.<br>Press "r" to reset the tracked BPM, or wait 5 seconds for it to reset.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Two different sin waves are calculated, added together, and clipped onto a circle. All of these have variables that are animated over delta time rather than framerate. The variables used in calculating the waves and rates of change are affected by the current BPM. Current BPM is sampled from the user tapping periodically, finding the intervals in between taps, and getting the weighted average.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.
					This experiment led to a pretty neat visual that is able to sync up to various BPMs. During the process, I did have to try out different ways of averaging tap intervals and did a lot of tweaking to the weighted averages to get it to feel good. I was surprised when I was having difficulty matching up the visuals to the BPM, as I thought it would be as simple as taking the BPM and adjusting the numbers by halving or doubling. It turns out that the visuals did not match as perfectly as expected, but after adjusting equations and variables, I was able to find what numbers were needed to have the visual match the BPM. As a final note, I will say the code that went into this could be structured better than it is currently, but I am glad I was able to at least achieve the functionality I was going for.
