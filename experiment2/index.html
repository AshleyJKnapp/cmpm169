				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Controls:<br/>Click anywhere on the canvas to grow a plant. Press 1, 2, and 3 to select the type of plant you are planting. Press C to clear all plants.<br/>Customize this shrimp tank with plants grown by L-systems!</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Plants are grown using L-systems, the three different types of plants use their own rulesets. The shrimp on screen move according to delta time to continue moving at a steady pace even when there are a lot of plants on the screen. The sketch drops frames when there are a couple of plants planted, even though it is set up to not calculate the L system each frame. It drops frames because there is still a lot of data to redraw each frame.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This experiment was pretty fun to do. I learned how L-systems work in better detail both through research and hand-on experimentation. I do want to think about ways to preserve the frame rate when there are many plants to draw, in case there is something I can do to optimize the drawing process.</p>
