			<h1>Experiment 5 - Campfire Storytime</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Press spacebar to rotate to the next part of the story.<br>Sitting around a campfire, a group tells one bit of a story at a time.<br>Collaboration between myself, <a href="https://github.com/Kevingallegos2003">Kevin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NateValley">Nate</a>.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>My group used Tracery and Phaser to create this. Each person in the group created our own grammar that would get displayed one at a time. Phaser is used to animate the image and control generating a new line of the story.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment started becoming really fun once I got my grammar in and it started generating sentences. It made me feel excited so I added a few more word variations. I also really enjoy the concept that we ended up going with, and I think Kevin's animation portrays the spinning well.</p>
